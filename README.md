Educational project. Its purpose was to demo creating basic web app with database connectivity and persistency.

Game Corner is website where you can explore video games. Inspired by popular platform Steam but lightweight version without ability to purchase games

There is possibility to register/login with really simple "security" on mind.

It contains admin panel with ability to add, edit or delete games.

User doesn't have that permissions rather it can list games, preview them, check their images/video, add/remove from favorites and preview all favorite games.
